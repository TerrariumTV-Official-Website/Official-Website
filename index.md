**Terrarium TV app has been shut down and discontinued. All its related operations have been ceased officially.** The developer will not contribute to or be involved in any streaming apps or services anymore.

**Terrarium TV app downloaded from an unknown source harms your device and exposes your IP address. We urge you to uninstall Terrarium TV and stop using it immediately!** All unofficially distributed versions of Terrarium TV are not affiliated with the original and official one.

For now, you will not be able to watch any video stream using Terrarium TV app as all the pages and screens will show “No Data” only. Clicking the update button will not update the app. **Version 9.9.9 does not exist. All development activities have been ceased and there will be no more updates.** Without any future updates, the app becomes useless as the code becomes outdated.

You can visit [JustWatch.com](https://www.justwatch.com/) or [Get It Right](https://www.getitrightfromagenuinesite.org) for legitimate streaming services and Terrarium TV alternatives! **You should only use legitimate applications like Netflix or Amazon Prime for watching or streaming movies and TV shows.**

Thank you and farewell.
